# Domain Reconnaissance Using WHOIS – Cybersecurity Mini Project

## 📌 Overview
WHOIS is a fundamental tool used in cybersecurity for gathering publicly available 
information about a domain. This passive reconnaissance technique helps understand 
a website’s ownership, registration, DNS details, and important security-related metadata.  

In this project, I performed WHOIS lookups on three popular domains to understand how 
domain records work and how information can be used during reconnaissance in ethical hacking.
